# Cost Tracking

There are several ways to track costs in this project, mainly with Langfuse and LiteLLM.

We use Langfuse to track costs.

## Requirements

1. Self-hosted Langfuse
1. A project on Langfuse
1. Project-specific private and public keys from Langfuse in `.env`

## Usage

With an `.env` based on `env.example` containing `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_PRIVATE_KEY`, the following code will log cost usage to Langfuse.

This sample code uses LangChain behind-the-scenes with a callback to Langfuse.

```python
from redpsy.monitoring.processors import InSilicoConversationProcessor

# Create processor instance
processor = InSilicoConversationProcessor(max_turns=2)

# For Jupyter notebooks, use this pattern instead of asyncio.run()
await processor.simulate_conversation("I feel depressed")
```
