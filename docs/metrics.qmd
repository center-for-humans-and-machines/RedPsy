Analyze synthetic dataset with calculated metrics.

## Self-BLEU

Calculate Self-BLEU using code from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/automated-metrics-for-evaluating-generated-text#self-bleu). Even though Self-BLEU has its downsides,
it is used in

```python
from redpsy.metrics import self_bleu

self_bleu.calculate_self_bleu(sentences)
```
